        Hi, I'm Nate. And this is a website I designed & developed to organize all the
        projects I've been working on. I am about to graduate from UCLA with a
        degree in economics and a minor in music industry. However, I also have
        a deep passion for software engineering and have been self studying for
        nearly 4 years. I'm hard working and extremely dedicated to the things
        I'm passionate about.
